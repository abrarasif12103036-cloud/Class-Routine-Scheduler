□ Navigate to: USB drive (your USB letter)
□ Right-click empty space
□ Select: Paste
□ Wait for copy to complete (2-5 minutes depending on speed)

Step 3: Verify copy
□ Check that "Routine Application" folder is on USB
□ Right-click "Routine Application" on USB
□ Select: Properties
□ Note the folder size (should be ~300 MB)

Step 4: Eject safely
□ Right-click USB drive in File Explorer
□ Select: Eject
□ Wait for confirmation
□ Physically remove USB drive


AFTER COPYING TO USB
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For the recipient:

□ Insert USB into their computer
□ Copy "Routine Application" folder from USB to local drive
  (C:\Users\[Username]\Desktop or Documents recommended)
□ Navigate to copied "Routine Application" folder
□ Double-click: START.bat
□ Wait 3-5 seconds
□ Application opens!

That's all they need to do!


QUICK DISTRIBUTION SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

What to copy:
☑ Entire "Routine Application" folder

What NOT to copy:
✗ Just the .exe file alone (won't work)
✗ Just some folders (will be incomplete)
✗ Individual files (backend won't work)

What to tell recipient:
"Copy the 'Routine Application' folder to your computer.
Then double-click START.bat. It will work immediately."


VERIFICATION AFTER USB COPY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To verify the USB copy is complete:

□ Insert USB into another computer
□ Check that "Routine Application" folder is there
□ Optional: Run VERIFY_SETUP.bat from the USB copy
  (This checks that all files are present)
□ Optional: Double-click START.bat to test
  (If it runs, the copy is perfect!)


TROUBLESHOOTING DURING COPY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Copy taking too long?
→ This is normal. ~300 MB can take 2-5 minutes
→ Don't interrupt the copy process
→ Be patient

Copy failed or interrupted?
→ Start over
→ Delete the incomplete "Routine Application" folder on USB
→ Re-copy from the original location

USB not showing up?
→ Try different USB port
→ Try different USB drive
→ Make sure USB has enough space (500 MB+)


MULTIPLE USB COPIES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To make multiple USB copies:

□ Complete the USB copy once (steps above)
□ Eject that USB
□ Insert a new USB drive
□ Repeat the copy process

You can make as many copies as needed!
